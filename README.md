# TurretMaster
 TurretMaster is a tower defense game.
 The goal consist into survive as far as possible until the castle isn't down.

 The map is an horizontal grid of 18:11 (for exemple). You can dispos one defense tower on each grid's tile. There is only one entrance and one exit for the mobs at the right and left grid' side.

 To win, you have to set up your strategy to prevent the castle destruction. For this, you can manage your towers as you want. However, you can't close the all ways leading to the castle.

 At each second of the game, the mods will find the best way to reach the castle. If the way doesn't exist, the mobs will destroy a tower to make one.

 Kill mobs means earn coins to upgrade or build tower. When a tower is build, you can only sell or upgrade it.
